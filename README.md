## Summary

Adds craftable tents that provide an additional spawn point to choose from upon death!

* Set up a temporary spawn point by crafting tents
* Choose to respawn between your tent or your bed
* Various tiers of tents with bonus utilities

Craft your first tent with Silk×2 and Wood×8 at a workbench!

## Details

You can set a Temporary Spawn Point by pressing the Interact button on a tent. Upon dying, the player will have a choice of respawning at their original spawn point, or at their temporary spawn point.

When re-entering a world, you will still start at spawn, or your bed. While you cannot return to a temporary spawn point with items such as Magic Mirror, you can teleport to it using a Wormhole Potion by clicking on it in the fullscreen map. 

Your active temporary spawn point is marked on the minimap by a tent icon.

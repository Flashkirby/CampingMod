## Summary

Adds craftable tents that provide an additional spawn point to choose from upon death!

* Set up a temporary spawn point by crafting tents
* Choose to spawn between your tent or your bed
* Various tiers of tents with bonus utilities

Craft your first tent with Silk×2 and Wood×8 at a workbench!

## Details

A temporary spawn point can be set alongside a normal spawn point, by interacting with a tent. Unlike beds, tents do not require valid housing to create a temporary spawn point, but these spawn points are not saved when exiting the world. 
When respawning, you can choose to spawn at either your original spawn point, or at the temporary spawn point.

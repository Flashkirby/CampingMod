This mod is set up for localisation, so we are accepting translations!

## Summary

Adds craftable tents that provide an additional spawn point to choose from upon death!

* Set up temporary spawn points by crafting tents
* Choose to spawn between your tent or your bed
* Various tiers of tents with bonus utilities
* Gear hammocks, chests that hang on the ceiling

Craft your first tent with Silk×2 and Wood×8 at a workbench, or a gear hammock with Cobweb×50.

As this was ported over from WeaponOut, any tents picked up or crafted from WeaponOut are converted to this mod's equivalent.

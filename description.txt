You can set a Temporary Spawn Point by pressing the Interact button on a tent. Upon dying, the player will have a choice of respawning at their original spawn point, or at their temporary spawn point.

When re-entering a world, you will still start at spawn, or your bed. While you cannot return to a temporary spawn point with items such as Magic Mirror, you can teleport to it using a Wormhole Potion by clicking on it in the fullscreen map. 

Your active temporary spawn point is marked on the minimap by a tent icon.

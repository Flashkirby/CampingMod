A temporary spawn point can be set alongside a normal spawn point, by interacting with a tent. Unlike beds, tents do not require valid housing to create a temporary spawn point, but these spawn points are not saved when exiting the world. 
When respawning, you can choose to spawn at either your original spawn point, or at the temporary spawn point.

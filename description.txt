Your Temporary Spawn Point is first activated when pressing the Interact button on a tent after entering a world or multiplayer server, and is de-activated upon leaving the world or disconnecting from the server. Unlike a normal spawn point, a temporary spawn point cannot be teleported to with standard recall items such as Magic Mirror.

Upon dying, the player will have a choice of respawning at their original spawn point, or at the temporary spawn point.

An active temporary spawn point is marked on the minimap by a tent icon.

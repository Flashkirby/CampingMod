[g:5] [c/FFFF00:Summary] [g:4] 
Adds craftable tents that provide an additional spawn point to choose from upon death!

[i/s1:184] Set up temporary spawn points by crafting tents
[i/s1:184] Choose to spawn between your tent or your bed
[i/s1:184] Various tiers of tents with bonus utilities
[i/s1:184] Gear hammocks, chests that hang on the ceiling

Craft your first tent with [i/si:225]×2 and [i/si:9]×8 at a workbench, or a gear hammock with [i/si:150]×50.

As this was ported over from WeaponOut, any tents picked up or crafted from WeaponOut are converted to this mod's equivalent.
